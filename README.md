# Convenient_Store

This Java program is like a virtual shopkeeper. It asks for your name and offers two choices: to manage the shop's items or to go shopping. If you choose shopping, it shows you what's available and lets you pick items and quantities. It calculates the total as you shop and generates a bill when you're done.

If you choose to manage items, it lets you add new items, remove existing ones, or update prices and quantities. It saves all changes for the next time.

Behind the scenes, it uses lists to keep track of items and a simple file to store them. And it uses a scanner to understand what you want to do. Overall, it's a basic but handy tool for managing a small shop.
